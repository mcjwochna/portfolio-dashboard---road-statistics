<h1>Portfolio - Road accidents dashboard</h1>

> This is a project that shows my ability to both create additional, necessary data (custom calendar table), manage relationships between tables and to use particular time-intelligence functions for getting the best, most useful insights.
<br>
<h2>Introduction</h2>

> This is an analysis of the road incidents in the United Kingdom between January 1st, 2021 and December 31th 2022. It is based on a singular dataset, consisting of more than 307 000 rows. Each row was described by number of variables like: number of casualties, number of vehicles, date and time of the accident, road conditions, speed limit etc.

<h2>Data Cleaning and Transformation</h2><br>

<b>Several steps were taken for this particular set of data:</b><br>
>Removed rows that had empty values,<br>
Transformed some texts (Accident_severity column),<br>
Removed columns, that are not useful to me.

<h2>Problem statement</h2>

<b>The goal of this analysis is to:</b><br>
>Determine the information about current year casualties and accidents,<br>
Know the difference between casualties based on the level of injuries,<br>
Know the diffrence between current year and previous year accidents, to idicate year-over-year changes,<br>
Compare the data based on various informations like vehicle type or road type,<br>
Indicate the frequency of accidents, based on geographical data (map)<br>

<h2>Skills and Concepts demonstrated</h2>

<b>I used PowerBI functions/concepts like:</b>
>Creating key performance indicators (KPIs),<br>
Developing general DAX calculations,<br>
Data Modelling,<br>
Measures,<br>
Filters,<br>
Custom tooltips,<br>
Data Visualization<br>
